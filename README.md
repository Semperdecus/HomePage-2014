# HomePage 2014
Simple website I made in 2014: https://semperdecus.github.io/HomePage-2014/index2.html

## Used technologies
- HTML, CSS, JS
- Google calendar API

## Features
  - Basic links for quick browsing
  - Google search bar
  - Integration with Google Calendars
  - Ability to add events to personal Google Calendar
  - Random video/song chooser from personal YouTube playlist

Moved from dropbox to github after dropbox removed hosting functions back in ~2016.
